Structs

Nested struct instance (structtype02) ✓
Array of struct elements (structtype03) ✓
Variable declaration with mixed struct/pointer to struct/array of struct declarators (structtype04) ✓
struct type with array member (structtype05, structtype06) ✓
array of pointers to structs

Type representation

char, signed char, unsigned char variables (basictype01) ✓
short, signed short, unsigned short variables (basictype02) ✓
int, signed int, unsigned int variables (basictype03) ✓
long, signed long, unsigned long variables (basictype04) ✓
"unsigned" and "signed" can be used to define variables (implicit int) (basictype05) ✓
"long int" and "short int" are allowed (basictype06) ✓
unusual orderings of basic type keywords (basictype07) ✓
qualified basic types (really only volatile will make sense due to lack of initialization) (basictype08) ✓

Type checking

assign array to pointer should be allowed
a pointer assignment which *adds* qualifiers should be allowed

Error checking

assignment to array should not be allowed
pointer assignment which drops const qualifier (badassign01)
pointer assignment which drops volatile qualifier (badassign02)
